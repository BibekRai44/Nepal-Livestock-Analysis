# Nepal Livestock Analysis

As a Data Enthusiastic, I explored the open Livestock Data published by Nepal Government. The data I have used for this project is publically available [here.](https://opendatanepal.com/dataset?organization=ministry-of-livestock-development&category=Agriculture)

 This project basically shows the Data in visual representation form making everyone understand the Data in meaningful way.
 ML models are built to predict the future results and so on.

 ## What I have done in this project?
 1) Data Collection , Data cleaning for Analysis
 2) Exploratory Data Analysis to identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data
 3) Data Visualization for understanding data in easiest way
 4) ML models for data-driven recommendations and decisions

 ## What tech stack is used here?
 1) Python 
 2) Python libraries like pandas,numpy for data cleaning and performing mathematical operation
 3) Python libraries like matplotlib,seaborn for visualizing Data
 4) Python libraries like scikit-learn to perform ML operation
